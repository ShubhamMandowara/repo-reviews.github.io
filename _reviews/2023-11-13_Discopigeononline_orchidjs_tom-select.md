# Summary
I am a recent bootcamp graduate and new to the coding world. As of now I dabble mostly in Ruby on Rails and rely heavily on gems to include feature I do not have the level to code yet.
Tom-select alowed me to add some neat tag selection feature on a project I add while really looking professional. It can be used in many languages and frameworks although my experience is limited to using it as a gem in ruby on rails.
It also offers selection boxes options (think dropdowns, single or multiple tag selection, autocomplete and a few more options).

# Pros
Beginner-friendly ease of use while offering some powerful and good-looking features for tags or selections boxes.
# Cons
Documentation is a bit succint for complete newbies and I did struggle for some time in order to get it imported correctly as a gem in my ruby on rails app.
# How to support author
